Architecture Overview

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
This application uses CQRS to separate read and write operations, improving scalability and maintainability. The command side handles modifications (create, update, delete), while the query side focuses on data retrieval.

MediatR
We employ MediatR to facilitate CQRS, allowing decoupled communication between components. It simplifies command and query handling, enabling clear separation of concerns. MediatR also supports pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns like logging and validation.

Conclusion
By implementing CQRS with MediatR in our .NET 8 CRUD application, we enhance performance and maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale as the application grows.
